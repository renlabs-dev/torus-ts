Torus is an open-ended stake-based p2p protocol encoding biological principles \
of autonomy and self-organization into coordination infrastructure.

Torus models intelligence as distributed, adaptive coordination under constraints: \
agents self-assemble, specialize, and align through recursive delegation, shared \
incentives, and feedback. It treats organization as a living process, not a fixed structure."""
