          "Stake is the root agent, genome and monetary energy container of the Torus, token emission flows are the organisms metabolism. The organisational complexity (Torus graph) emerges from it, coerced to continuously align back to it. Its agents all the way down.",

          "Continuous alignment towards the stake root emerges naturally in the delegation tree hierarchies through selective pressure at every edge. Each agent's success and survival depends on being selected by the level above, creating a chain of interdependent selection processes. ",
