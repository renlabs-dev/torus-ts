# Running a Local Subspace Chain

This guide explains how to set up and run a local Subspace blockchain node, noting that its storage may differ slightly from the mainnet.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Subspace blockchain node repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/torus-ai/subspace
cd subspace
```

### 2. Build the Project

Compile the project using Cargo:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Optional: If you want to include the testnet faucet, use:

```sh
cargo build --release --features testnet-faucet
```

### 3. Run the Node

Start your local node:

```sh
cargo xtask run --alice
```

You can also run a second node with:

```sh
cargo xtask run --bob
```

### 4. Connect to Your Node

Once the node is running, you can connect to it at:

`ws://localhost:30341`

## Additional Information

- The `--alice` and `--bob` flags are used to run predefined validator nodes.
- You can customize your node's configuration by modifying the appropriate files in the project.
