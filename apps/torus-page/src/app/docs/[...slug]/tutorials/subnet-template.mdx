## Template TL;DR

To make things easier for subnet builders.
torus AI provides a subnet template that you can get started off of.

## Dependencies

The whole subnet template is built on top of the [torusX library / SDK](https://github.com/renlabs-dev/torusx).
Which is truly the only essential dependency.

Although in order to make the template more explicit we also provide additional libraries.
You can find the whole dependency list we used in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.

```txt
torusx
typer
uvicorn
keylimiter
pydantic-settings
```

## Miner

From the root of your project, you can just call **comx module serve**. For example:

```sh
comx module serve torus-subnet-template.subnet.miner.model.Miner <name-of-your-com-key> [--subnets-whitelist <your-subnet-netuid>] \
[--ip <text>] [--port <number>]
```

## Validator

To run the validator, just call the file in which you are executing **validator.validate_loop()**. For example:

```sh
python3 -m torus-subnet-template.subnet.cli <name-of-your-com-key>
```
